This commandline program was a script I decided to create when I noticed one of my fellow interns working 
alone and for too many hours on a very manual task. I wanted to help. My fellow intern was tasked with opening or 
closing bootcamp student accounts depending on whether they passed their room inspections for the housing. 
<br /><br /> 
The RA's for the dorms used an Excel spreadsheet so to keep it familiary, I utilized an almost identical format with Google Sheets. This allowed me to design a simple familiar form to be filled out, and also allowed for automation using the Google Sheets API. Data from the inspections was pulled from the form's cells, stored, and then depending the results, chose which students accounts to temporarily close or reopen using the school's API. It took a 4 - 5 hour task and made it a 15 - 30 seconds. 

### Built With

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The official desktop application was not meant for being open-sourced and therefore
is not for use in it's full functionality to be reproduced locally. This is because of the permissions required including: staff/employee permissions, API scope and other necessary info not accessible to the public. The application's code has been modified and commit history scrubbed. Confidential information and files integral to its functioning have therefore been removed. 

To see the code, please visit: <a href="https://github.com/MooseandSquvirrel/fs_drms_demo.git">The Code</a>
